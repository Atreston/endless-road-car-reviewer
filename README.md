# Workflow and steps followed in development
### workflow
1. Create meteor-svelte project with the command `meteor create --svelte simple-project`
2. Install PostCSS by:
	1. `meteor remove standard-minifier-css`
	2. `meteor add juliancwirko:postcss`
	3. `meteor npm install --save-dev postcss@8.4.6 postcss-load-config@3.1.1`
	4. Add the PostCSS configuration object inside `package.json`
```json
"postcss": {
    "plugins": {
      "postcss-plugin-one": {},
      "postcss-plugin-two": {},
      "postcss-plugin-etc": {}
    }
  }
```

The package `postcc-load-config` loads the postcss plugins specified in this postcss property inside the `package.json` of the project.

Make sure that the plugins that you list in "plugins" are also in "devDependencies" as well.

5. Install `postcss-import` with the command `meteor.bat npm install -D postcss-import`
6. Install tailwindcss with the command `meteor npm install -D tailwindcss autoprefixer`
7. Create the configuration file for tailwind with the command `meteor npx tailwindcss init`
8. Test the application with `meteor run`

### not working
1. Create a plain mockup
2. Create an empty meteor project
3. Copy mockup files inside meteor project
4. Install TailwindCSS in meteor
5. Test
6. `meteor remove standard-minifier-css`
7. `meteor add juliancwirko:postcss`
8. create `./.postcssrc.js`
9. add contents to `.postcssrc.js` file
10. change contents of `.\client\main.css`
11. `meteor npx tailwindcss init` to create `.\tailwind.config.js`
12. add contents to `tailwind.config.js`
13. Test
14. `meteor npm install --save-dev postcss@latest postcss-load-config@latest`
15. `meteor npm install --save-dev postcss@latest postcss-load-config@latest`
16. `meteor npm install`

# Concepts, FAQs, and HowTos

## How to Fetch Data in Svelte
Let’s start by importing the `onMount` hook from Svelte, like so:

```javascript
import { onMount } from "svelte";
```

Next, we’re going to define a variable to hold the URL of the endpoint we intend to use:

```javascript
const endpoint = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts";
```

>_Note: [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) is a handy, free, online REST API that you can use whenever you need some fake data._

Next, create a `posts` variable and assign an empty array to it:

```javascript
let posts = [];
```

This empty `posts` array is going to be filled up with the data we receive from our API once we make the call.

Finally, we can now make use of the `onMount()` method to make a `GET` request to the endpoint using JavaScript’s Fetch API as shown below:

```javascript
onMount(async function () {
  const response = await fetch(endpoint);
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
});
```

When pieced together, your `App` component should contain the following:

```html
<script>
  import { onMount } from "svelte";
  const endpoint = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts";
  let posts = [];

  onMount(async function () {
    const response = await fetch(endpoint);
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  });

  export let name;
</script>

<main>
  <h1>Hello {name}!</h1>
  <p>Visit the <a href="https://svelte.dev/tutorial">Svelte tutorial</a> to learn how to build Svelte apps.</p>
</main>

<style>
  /* ommitted for brevity */
</style>
```

### Displaying data from the endpoint
We can now render the content fetched into our page:

```html
{#each posts as article}
  <div>
    <p>{article.title}</p>
  </div>
{/each}
```

Change the markup in `App.svelte` to the following:

```html
<main>
  <h1>Hello {name}!</h1>
  <p>Visit the <a href="https://svelte.dev/tutorial">Svelte tutorial</a> to learn how to build Svelte apps.</p>

  {#each posts as article}
    <div>
      <p>{article.title}</p>
    </div>
  {/each}
</main>
```

Then add the following line to the script block:

```javascript
posts = data;
```

### Lazy loading in javascript
#### What is lazy image loading?
Many websites like Facebook, Linkedin, Pinterest or ecommerce sites like Flipkart, Amazon have lots of image, They do no load all image at once on page load.

Instead what they do is load images as we scroll down or the image is in the viewport of the screen.

```javascript
//Prefetch all the images
//Repeating this inside function will hamper the performance
let lazyImages = [...document.querySelectorAll('.lazy-image')];
//Buffer
let inAdvance = 50;
const lazyLoad = () => {
    //Iterate all the images and check
    lazyImages.forEach(image => {
        if (image.offsetTop < window.innerHeight + window.pageYOffset + inAdvance) { 
             //if image is in viewport set the src from custom attribute //dataset is used to get the custom attribute
             image.src = image.dataset.src; 

             //if the image is loaded then add class to it 
             image.onload = () => image.classList.add('loaded')
        }
    });
};
//Call the function to load the first image 
lazyLoad();
//lazy load the function when window is scrolled
window.addEventListener('scroll', throttle(lazyLoad, 700));
//lazy load the function when window is resized
window.addEventListener('resize', throttle(lazyLoad, 700));
```

## Lifecycle / onMount in svelte
Every component has a _lifecycle_ that starts when it is created, and ends when it is destroyed. There are a handful of functions that allow you to run code at key moments during that lifecycle.

The one you'll use most frequently is `onMount`, which runs after the component is first rendered to the DOM. We briefly encountered it [earlier](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/bind-this) when we needed to interact with a `<canvas>` element after it had been rendered.

We'll add an `onMount` handler that loads some data over the network:

```html
<script>
	import { onMount } from 'svelte';

	let photos = [];

	onMount(async () => {
		const res = await fetch(`/tutorial/api/album`);
		photos = await res.json();
	});
</script>
```

>It's recommended to put the `fetch` in `onMount` rather than at the top level of the `<script>` because of server-side rendering (SSR). With the exception of `onDestroy`, lifecycle functions don't run during SSR, which means we can avoid fetching data that should be loaded lazily once the component has been mounted in the DOM.

Lifecycle functions must be called while the component is initialising so that the callback is bound to the component instance — not (say) in a `setTimeout`.

If the `onMount` callback returns a function, that function will be called when the component is destroyed.

#### What is lazy loading?
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_loading), lazy loading is a pattern designed to hold off the initialization of an element or an object until it is needed. What this means is that a target DOM element, relative to a parent DOM element, is loaded and becomes visible (when there is an intersection between both elements, based on a set threshold value) only when a user scrolls through them on a webpage.

The disadvantages of not employing this pattern can lead to:

-   Huge lag in page performance due to multiple synchronous network requests or batch requests to fetch a couple of images or other web resources from one or more sources
-   Increase in page load time due to the size of the bundle to be downloaded/fetched
-   Low user retention, mostly applicable in areas with poor internet connectivity. It is not uncommon for users to avoid a platform entirely when we developers make the mistake of not implementing lazy loading early on
-   A huge impact on web performance and accessibility caused by resources or assets like images, iframes, and videos that are not properly handled

Currently, lazy loading is natively supported on the web for most modern and updated browsers. However, for browsers that don’t offer this support yet, polyfills or libraries that implement this technique provide simple API layers above them.

Forking projects to make your own changes lets you easily integrate your own contributions. But if you’re not sending those changes back upstream—which means sending it back to the parent repository—you’re at risk for losing track of them, which can cause divergent lines in your repository. To make sure all contributors are drawing from the same place, you’ll need to know some principles of how git forking interacts with git upstream.

Forking projects to make your own changes lets you easily integrate your own contributions. But if you’re not sending those changes back upstream—which means sending it back to the parent repository—you’re at risk for losing track of them, which can cause divergent lines in your repository. To make sure all contributors are drawing from the same place, you’ll need to know some principles of how git forking interacts with git upstream.

First, verify that you have already setup a remote for the `upstream` repository, and hopefully an `origin` too:

```shell
git remote -v
origin  git@bitbucket.org:my-user/some-project.git (fetch)
origin  git@bitbucket.org:my-user/some-project.git (push)
```

If you don't have an `upstream` you can easily add it with the `remote` command:

```
git remote add upstream git@bitbucket.org:some-gatekeeper-maintainer/some-project.git
```
